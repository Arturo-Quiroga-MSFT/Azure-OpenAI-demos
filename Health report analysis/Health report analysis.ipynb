Le patient a fait une cathétérisme cardiaque en juillet de cette année, révélant une occlusion totale de la coronaire gauche et une maladie de 50% du tronc coronaire gauche, avec un historique familial important de maladie coronaire avec un frère décédé à l'âge de 52 ans d'un infarctus et un autre frère qui est post-greffe de pontage coronaire. Le patient a fait une échocardiographie d'effort en juillet 2001, qui n'a montré aucune anomalie du mouvement de la paroi, mais ce fut une étude difficile en raison de la corpulence. Le patient a fait six minutes avec une dépression minime des ST dans les leads antéro-latéraux, pensée due à la fatigue et à la douleur au poignet, son équivalent anginal. En raison des symptômes accrus du patient et de son historique de maladie du tronc coronaire gauche avec une occlusion totale de sa coronaire droite, le patient a été référé pour une revascularisation par chirurgie cardiaque ouverte.\n"
