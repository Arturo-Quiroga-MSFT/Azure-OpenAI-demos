    "Custom text to speech avatar allows you to create a customized, one-of-a-kind synthetic talking avatar for your application. With custom text to speech avatar, you can build a unique and natural-looking avatar for your product or brand by providing video recording data of your selected actors. If you also create a custom neural voice for the same actor and use it as the avatar's voice, the avatar will be even more realistic.\n",
