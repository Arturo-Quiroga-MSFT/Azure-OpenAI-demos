       "      <td>An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.</td>\n",

Sportsmail revealed Villa have held talks over 22-year-old Andone earlier this week and will look to strike a bargain for the player.

The Romanian has scored six goals in 17 games for the struggling Spanish side this season . The Romanian has scored six goals in 17 games for the struggling Spanish side who are rooted to the bottom of La Liga. Andone was born in Romania but moved to Spain when he was 12. He was only promoted to the senior team in December and following his impressive form he has since been called up to the Romanian national side. The player is valued at around £6million but it is thought Villa could sign him in a cut-price deal should Cordoba lose their La Liga status. Villa manager Tim Sherwood could add Andone to his striking options in the summer .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Doctors who treated brain cancer sufferer Ashya King in Britain yesterday accused the boy’s parents of putting his life at risk when they refused to let him have chemotherapy. Consultant Peter Wilson told a BBC TV documentary Ashya’s chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King’s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here. Dr Wilson, clinical director for child health at Southampton General Hospital, claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five-year-old’s cancer returning. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . And in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme he complained of the ‘vitriol’ to which he had been subjected as a result of the case, saying: ‘I personally received a letter from a person who said they wished my children got cancer and died.’ Mr and Mrs King had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a ‘vegetable’ and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy, an alternative form of radiotherapy. Mr King, 51, said Ashya did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission. Last month, four months after the proton treatment ended, the family said scans showed ‘no evidence’ of the tumour. But Dr Wilson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July, and said it was too early to say he had been cured. He told the BBC: ‘We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is… every month that goes by that he’s not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . ‘There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival – so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, which is quite dramatic.’ Dr Wilson said there was an ‘international consensus’ of medical opinion that Ashya’s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After he had the surgery in Southampton his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors. He was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed. They initially fled to Spain where they were arrested then released after the High Court approved their plan to take Ashya to Prague. The NHS eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there. Dr Wilson said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery, and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return. The Kings were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted Ashya to receive the best possible treatment. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children .</td>\n",

       "2365   An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.  \\\n",

Premier League side Aston Villa could sign Cordoba striker Florin Andone (left) for as little as £2.5million . The Romanian has scored six goals in 17 games for the struggling Spanish side this season . The Romanian has scored six goals in 17 games for the struggling Spanish side who are rooted to the bottom of La Liga. Andone was born in Romania but moved to Spain when he was 12. He was only promoted to the senior team in December and following his impressive form he has since been called up to the Romanian national side. The player is valued at around £6million but it is thought Villa could sign him in a cut-price deal should Cordoba lose their La Liga status. Villa manager Tim Sherwood could add Andone to his striking options in the summer .   \n",

Consultant Peter Wilson told a BBC TV documentary Ashya’s chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King’s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here. Dr Wilson, clinical director for child health at Southampton General Hospital, claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five-year-old’s cancer returning. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an ‘impossible situation’ as a result of King family’s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . And in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme he complained of the ‘vitriol’ to which he had been subjected as a result of the case, saying: ‘I personally received a letter from a person who said they wished my children got cancer and died.’ Mr and Mrs King had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a ‘vegetable’ and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy, an alternative form of radiotherapy. Mr King, 51, said Ashya did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission. Last month, four months after the proton treatment ended, the family said scans showed ‘no evidence’ of the tumour. But Dr Wilson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July, and said it was too early to say he had been cured. He told the BBC: ‘We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is… every month that goes by that he’s not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . ‘There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival – so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, which is quite dramatic.’ Dr Wilson said there was an ‘international consensus’ of medical opinion that Ashya’s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After he had the surgery in Southampton his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors. He was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed. They initially fled to Spain where they were arrested then released after the High Court approved their plan to take Ashya to Prague. The NHS eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there. Dr Wilson said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery, and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return. The Kings were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted Ashya to receive the best possible treatment.

       "      <td>An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.</td>\n",

A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.  \\\n",

       "2365  An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.  \\\n",

       "2365  An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see  \\\n",

       "      <td>An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.</td>\n",

       "2365  An Iranian cleric is teaching his followers that thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife will make your children gay. Ayatollah Hossein Dehnavi, a celebrity preacher in Iran, made the speech to a packed auditorium of men and women in his home country. It is the latest controversial teaching put forward by Dehnavi, who also warned that if women did not wear the hijab - the veil covering the hair and chest - properly, they could inadvertently cause some men to become homosexual. Islamic cleric Dehnavi is a celebrity in his native Iran, giving speeches on relationships and family values . While thinking about another woman while having sex with your wife is not a sin, the Iranian ayatollah preaches, if she becomes pregnant it will mean the child will be gay. Homosexuality is punishable by death in the state . On past occasions He has preached that women must provide sex to their husbands at all times - and said women who are better educated or are financially independent 'harm men's authority'. 'One of the other duties of women in regard to their men is to take care of their men’s instinctive needs [sexual drive]', the cleric said in a report by The Clarion Project, an organisation against extremism. 'Do not break their pride and [you must] be more sensitive toward them' During another speech, the ayatollah explain that it is not a sin for a man to think about another woman while he is having sex with his partner, but if she becomes pregnant as a result the child will be gay. Incorrectly wearing the hijab, Dehnavi also warns, could lead to some men becoming homosexual. Hundreds of women attend the lectures and speeches of the Muslim cleric, whose is also regularly shown on state TV . The statements, thought to have been made in 2012 and 2013, came to light after being shared by Gay Star News this week. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in Iran, with gay and lesbian people forced to hide their sexuality. A man involved in the 'dominant' role in sodomy faces being flogged up to 100 times if he is unmarried and the sex is consensual, while the man playing the 'passive' can still be put to death regardless of his marriage status, according to a report in The Guardian. Lesbians faced being whipped 100 times, but sex between two women can also lead to the death penalty if the act is committed four times. Following his teachings, Dehavni says, will ultimately lead to 'peace on earth'. In another speech he controversially suggested that women should always be sexually available for their husbands . Men become 'saturated' if they have too much sex, Dehavni warns - suggesting becoming intimate once or twice a week is enough. He also says women can make their husbands aroused by showing off their armpits . Dehavni is a celebrated cleric in Iran, whose speeches on family life and marital affairs are shown on state TV and who people queue up for tickets to see him speak live, according to Iran Wire. The 53-year-old grandfather has himself been married for 30 years . In other speeches he warns Iranian couples not to have too much sex: '.. only once or twice a week, not every day. Otherwise the wan will become saturated.' He also suggests paler women wear black underwear and show off the most attractive parts of their bodies - their armpits and chest - to entice their husbands. By perfecting the art of lovemaking, he suggests, couples will have bigger families with strong Muslim values which will ultimately lead to peace on earth.  \\\n",
