We can approach this problem using linear algebra. \\n\\nFirst, we can simplify the three given equations to a standard form \\n\\nax + by + cz = k; where k represents the constant on the right side of the equation.\\n\\nThe equations then become: \\n\\n1. ax + by + cz = x+7 \\n2. bx + cy + az = 2x+6y \\n3. cx + ay + bz = 4x+y \\n\\nTaking the constants from the right side of the equation to the left side when necessary, we get:\\n\\n1. (a - 1)x + by + cz = 7 \\n2. bx + (c - 6)y + az = 2x \\n3. cx + ay + (b - 1)z = 4x \\n\\nEach equation should be equal to zero for further convenience:\\n\\n1. (a - 1)x + by + cz - 7 = 0 \\n2. bx + (c - 6)y + az - 2x = 0 \\n3. cx + ay + (b - 1)z - 4x = 0 \\n\\nLet's then solve it in Python using sympy library that allows to perform symbolic computation.\\n\\nPlease, execute the following python code block. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\\n\\n# define symbols\\na, b, c, x, y, z = symbols('a b c x y z')\\n\\n# provide the equations\\nequations = (Eq((a - 1)*x + b*y + c*z, 7),\\n             Eq(b*x + (c - 6)*y + a*z, 2*x),\\n             Eq(c*x + a*y + (b - 1)*z, 4*x))\\n\\n# solve the system of equations\\nsolution = solve(equations, (a, b, c))\\n\\n# print the solution\\nprint('The solutions are: ', solution)\\n```\\n\\nThis piece of code defines the system of equations as described above. The 'solve()' function then finds a, b, c that satisfy all the three equations.\\n\\nThe result will be a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the values of a, b, c that solve the equations for a possible value of x, y, z. We will choose a solution that satisfies the condition x+y \\u2260 -1. \\n\\nOnce we get the values for a, b, and c, we can solve for a+b+c. \\n\\nPlease execute the python code block to proceed with the task.\",\n",
